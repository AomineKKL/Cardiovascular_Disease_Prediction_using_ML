# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Decision Trees and Logistic Regression

This project is focused on the prediction of cardiovascular disease using machine learning algorithms, specifically decision trees and logistic regression. The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains demographic, behavioral, and medical information from patients of a clinical study conducted in the city of Porto, Portugal.

## Dataset

The dataset contains some of the records with 12 features that can be used to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease in a patient. The dataset features include age, gender, blood pressure, smoking status, alcohol intake, and other medical conditions. The target variable for this project is a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models using decision trees and logistic regression to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. The performance of these models will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Project Files
The project files include:

cardiovascular_disease_prediction.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing the data cleaning, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


## Project Dependencies
The project dependencies include:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Conclusion

The project demonstrates how decision trees and logistic regression can be used to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. The models achieved high accuracy and F1 scores, indicating their effectiveness in predicting cardiovascular disease. This project can be useful for healthcare professionals and researchers interested in using machine learning to predict and prevent cardiovascular disease.
